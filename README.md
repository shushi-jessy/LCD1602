# LCD1602
Arduino LCD1602 Lib

Hello everyon,

This is a init version that i found in my old pc. I remember it worked fine. I will update this into a standard C or C++ library in the future.

It is similar to arduino standard LCD library but this is the version that i created mannuel by reffering to each function in the datasheet. It was really intresting to create your own library function by function.

Thanks for comming.
